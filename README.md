## Chatbot project using Transformers

Digital assistants, like Apple Siri, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana, have become increasingly popular in the NLP community due to their ability to imitate human thoughts, logic, and emotions through language. These assistants, which are readily accessible through our smartphones, may not be perfect but are still capable of listening and responding to user input.

### DialoGPT

DialoGPT is a type of pretrained transformer language model developed by OpenAI. Transformers are a type of artificial neural network designed to process sequential data, such as natural language text. Pretraining refers to the process of training a model on a large corpus of data before fine-tuning it on a smaller, specific task.

In the case of DialoGPT, the model was trained on a large dataset of text conversations to generate human-like responses in a conversational setting. This means that the model has already learned general patterns and structures in language before it is fine-tuned for a specific task, such as customer service or generating chatbot responses. The result is a model that can generate more human-like responses with a higher degree of fluency and coherence compared to models that are only trained on the specific task.

### Steps 
- Install Library
- Import Library
- Build conversational pipeline
- Add starting conversation 
- Add continuing conversations 

Note: Install tensorflow or pytorch so that transformer use any of those in the backend.
